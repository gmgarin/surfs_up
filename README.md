# Surfs_Up 

## **Overview of the Statiscal Analysis**
### The purpose of this project analysis was to analyze the temperature data for the months of June (2010 - 2017) and December (2010 - 2016). Specifically, with the use of Python SQL Toolkit and Object Relational Mapper, the data were retrieved and transformed into DataFrames. The results from this will be used to determine sustainability of opening a surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii. 

## **Results**
### After careful analysis of the data, the following results were yielded:
- **June Temperature**
    - The average temperature recorded for June is 74.9 F and the maximum and minimum temperatures recorded were 85.0 F and 64.0 F respectively. This was done using *describe()* function. Complete summary statistics is shown in the picture below:

- **December Temperature**
    - The average temperature recorded for December is 71.0 F and the maximum and minimum temperatures recorded were 56.0 F and 83.0 F respectively. Similarly, this results were obtained using *describe()* function. Below is the complete statical summary of data for December.

- **More Statistical Differences**
    - The amount of data for June and December are different. There were 1700 temperatures recorded for June and 1517 for December. 

## **Summary**
### The statiscal analysis of the results shows that there is a slight difference in average temperatures between the months of June and December. The temperature in December is sightly cooler than in June. However, this slight difference is almost neglible. In addition, during the month of December, the expected average temperature in the continental United States and North America is substantially lower than Hawaii. This means that many people from Northen America tend to visit places with warmer temperature, such as Hawaii, during the winter season. Therefore, temperature-wise, opening a surf shop could be a sustainable business.

### While average temperature is a good factor to consider in opening a surf shop, it is not the only deciding factors to determine the sustainability of a surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii. Other factors that could be included are average precipitation, weather trends throughout the year, and/or extreme weather events that affect Oahu, Hawaii. 

### An additional query  and analysis on average precipitation level would also be a vital information to consider. Too much precipitation could certainly impact a surf shop business.

### Another query on extreme weather events should also be considered. Getting this information can certainly help in determining the viabilty of this business. The particulars such as number of typhoons/hurricanes and earth quakes that can cause Tsunami waves, are also significant in this case.
